# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Code Conclave, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the repository owner via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include a description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Security Practices

### API Key Handling

Code Conclave never stores API keys in configuration files or source code. All provider credentials are read exclusively from environment variables at runtime:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` for Azure OpenAI

### Error Sanitization

All error messages are sanitized before display to prevent accidental credential leakage in logs or CI output. The sanitizer redacts:

- API key patterns (`sk-ant-*`, `sk-*`, Bearer tokens)
- Authorization headers
- User home directory paths

### Container Security

The Docker container runs as a non-root user (`conclave`) with read-only access to the mounted repository.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Code Conclave tool itself. Findings generated by Code Conclave about your codebase are informational and should be validated by a human reviewer.
