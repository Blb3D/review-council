## Critical Gaps

{{#IF_CRITICAL_GAPS}}
The following controls are marked critical and are not addressed by current findings:

{{CRITICAL_GAP_LIST}}

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Prioritize reviews targeting these controls
2. Run focused agent reviews with `-Standard {{STANDARD_ID}}`
3. Document compensating controls if technical controls are not feasible

## Next Steps

1. **Address Critical Gaps First**
   - Focus on controls marked as critical
   - Run targeted agent reviews

2. **Document Compensating Controls**
   - Where technical controls are not feasible
   - Document alternative mitigations

3. **Re-run Compliance Mapping**
   ```
   ccl -Map ./project/.code-conclave/reviews -Standard {{STANDARD_ID}}
   ```

4. **Generate Updated Report**
   ```
   ccl report ./project/.code-conclave --template gap-analysis --standard {{STANDARD_ID}}
   ```
