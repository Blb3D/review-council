    requirement: |
      This International Standard specifies requirements for a quality management 
      system that can be used by an organization involved in one or more stages 
      of the life-cycle of a medical device, including design and development, 
      production, storage and distribution, installation, servicing and final 
      decommissioning and disposal of medical devices, and design and development, 
      or provision of associated activities (e.g., technical support).
      
      The requirements in this International Standard can also be used by suppliers 
      or other external parties that provide product, including quality management 
      system-related services to such organizations.
