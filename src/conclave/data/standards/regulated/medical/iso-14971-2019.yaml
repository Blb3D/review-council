notes:
  - "ISO 14971 is THE risk management standard for medical devices - referenced by all major regulations"
  - "2019 edition emphasizes benefit-risk analysis more than previous versions"
  - "Clause 10 (post-production) significantly expanded from 2007 edition"
  - "FMEA alone does NOT satisfy ISO 14971 requirements"
  - "Manufacturer must define their own risk acceptability criteria"
  - "Risk control priority order (design > protective measures > information) is mandatory"
  - "ISO/TR 24971:2020 provides essential implementation guidance"
  - "EU MDR/IVDR have additional requirements beyond ISO 14971"
